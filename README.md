# 🚀 Future Projects & Inspirations

This repository is a living roadmap of where I’m headed—projects I plan to build, problems I want to solve, and the inspirations that shape my work. It reflects my long-term goal of growing into a strong software engineer with a focus on **AI, systems programming, and full‑stack development**.

---

## 🌱 Vision

To design practical, impactful software that blends **theoretical foundations** with **real‑world needs**—especially in education, healthcare, and intelligent systems.

## 🔮 Planned & Future Projects

### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Intelligent Systems

* **Personal AI Assistant (C++)**
  An offline-first assistant for managing notes, tasks, and daily feedback using efficient data structures.
* **AI for Research Support**
  Tools to summarize papers, extract key ideas, and assist with academic research workflows.
* **Introductory ML Projects**
  Classification, prediction, and recommendation systems built from the ground up to strengthen fundamentals.

### 🖥️ Systems & Low-Level Programming

* **CPU Scheduling Simulators (C/C++)**
  Implementations of FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin with visual output.
* **Operating System Concepts Toolkit**
  Small programs demonstrating synchronization, deadlocks, memory management, and I/O handling.
* **Performance-Oriented Data Structures**
  Custom implementations of linked lists, trees, and hash tables with benchmarks.

### 🌐 Web & Database Applications

* **Doctor–Patient Management System**
  A secure web-based platform with role-based authentication, analytics, and reporting.
* **State Land Allocation Management System (SLAMS)**
  A database-driven system focused on transparency, normalization, and data integrity.
* **API-First Backend Services**
  RESTful APIs using PHP/Laravel with MySQL, emphasizing clean architecture and scalability.

### 📊 Data & Databases

* **Database Design Case Studies**
  ER modeling, normalization (1NF → BCNF), and query optimization on real scenarios.
* **SQL Practice Engine**
  A collection of progressively challenging SQL problems with solutions.

## 💡 Inspirations

* **Problem-Solving Mindset** – Turning abstract concepts from mathematics, OS, and databases into working systems.
* **Real-World Impact** – Building tools that can realistically be adopted in local contexts such as education and healthcare.
* **Learning by Building** – Mastery comes from implementation, not theory alone.
* **Open Knowledge** – Sharing code, ideas, and documentation to help others learn.
